  abstract =                   {{H}ighly reduced and ordered {T}i{O}2 nanotube arrays have been fabricated
   using two-step anodization and three-electrode reduction. {A}
   proton-electron coupled reduction mechanism has been proposed based on
   the combined paradigms of a conventional energy-band model and chemical
   evolution of basic building blocks of {T}i{O}2. {U}nder optimized reduction
   conditions, about 22\% of {T}i4+ ions in tube surface regions are
   converted into {T}i3+ ions while the morphology of the highly reduced {T}i{O}2
   nanotube arrays keeps unchanged. {T}he reduced nanotube arrays show
   superior electrochemical properties such as high areal capacitance, good
   rate capability, and high cycling stability. {T}he areal capacitance of
   the reduced electrode is 24.07 m{F} cm(-2) at a scan rate of 10 m{V} s(-1),
   much higher than that of the pristine {T}i{O}2 nanotube arrays (0.02 m{F}
   cm(-2)). {T}his kind of highly reduced one-dimensional oxide
   nanostructures can find a large array of applications in
   supercapacitors, photocatalysis, electrochromic display, and {L}i ion
   batteries. ({C}) 2015 {P}ublished by {E}lsevier {L}td.},

  abstract =                   {{I}t is well known anodic {T}i{O}2 nanotubes ({ATNT}s) can be obtained by the
   anodization of {T}i foils in fluoride-containing solutions, and the
   nanotube diameter is proportional to the applied voltages. {H}owever, the
   growth kinetics of {ATNT}s and the relationship between structural
   features and anodizing parameters still remain unclear. {C}hallenges
   always remain in the fabrication of {ATNT}s with large diameters due to
   the undesired breakdown event under the high voltage in {NH}4{F} solutions.
   {H}ere, an interesting approach is first proposed to overcome these
   particular challenges. {A} series of constant current anodizing processes
   in fluoride-free {H}3{PO}4 solutions, {NH}4{F} solutions of different
   concentrations (0.7 wt\%, 0.5 wt\% and 0.2 wt \%), and different mixed
   electrolytes containing both {NH}4{F} and {H}3{PO}4, have been compared in
   detail. {A}nd we mainly focused on the influence of the different ratios
   of {NH}4{F} and {H}3{PO}4 on the outer diameters of {ATNT}s and the correlation
   between two types of films. {T}he interesting results show that the
   nanotube diameter greatly increases with {H}3{PO}4 amount in the solutions
   with a given concentration of {NH}4{F}. {I}n contrast, the nanotube length
   decreases with the increase of {H}3{PO}4 amount in the solutions with a
   given concentration of {NH}4{F}. {T}he experimental findings and the undesired
   breakdown phenomenon can be elucidated by the theory of the electronic
   current and ionic current rather than by the field-assisted dissolution.

   were successfully fabricated by electrochemical anodization in ethylene
   glycol-based electrolytes with various {NH}4{F} concentrations. {H}ydrogen
   production by photocatalytic water splitting was performed in a
   two-compartment photoelectrochemical ({PEC}) cell without any applied
   voltage. {T}he effect of {NH}4{F} concentration on the morphological
   structure, {PEC} performance and hydrogen evolution of {T}i{O}2 samples were

   concentration for 60 min exhibited highest hydrogen evolution of 2.53 m{L}
   h(-1) cm(-2) and maximum photoconversion efficiency of 4.39\%. {B}ased on
   the above results and the different current-time curves during
   anodization processes, another series of {T}i{O}2 nanotube arrays samples
   with the equal charge consumption (designated as {T}i{O}2 {N}ts-{EC}) were
   synthesized by controlling the anodization time in electrolytes
   containing different {NH}4{F} concentrations. {C}ompared with {T}i{O}2 {N}ts
   prepared at the same {NH}4{F} concentration for 60 min, hydrogen production
   and {PEC} properties of {T}i{O}2 {N}ts-{EC} samples have been obviously enhanced,
   especially for the sample prepared at 1.25 wt\% {NH}4{F} concentrations.
   {M}oreover, despite the difference of {NH}4{F} concentration in electrolyte,
   the {T}i{O}2 {N}ts-{EC} samples exhibit comparable {PEC} performances. {T}hese
   results indicated that the anodization charge-density play a crucial
   role in the hydrogen generation of {T}i{O}2 {N}ts. {T}he results benefit the

  abstract =                   {{N}anoporous anodic titanium oxide ({ATO}) layers with different cell sizes,
   pore diameters and the thicknesses are successfully grown by three-step
   self-organized anodization in ethylene glycol containing 0.38 wt\% of
   {NH}4{F} and 1.79 wt\% of {H}2{O} at applied potential differences ranging from
   30 {V} to 70 {V} at various electrolyte temperatures. {A} relatively high
   growth speed (about 40 mu m h(-1)) of nanopore arrays is achieved at 30
   degrees {C} under the potential difference of 70 {V}. {T}he morphology and the
   structure of {ATO} layers are directly affected by anodizing conditions,
   especially temperature and potential difference. {I}t was found that the
   oxide thickness and the cell size are linearly dependent on anodizing
   potential difference. {O}n the other hand, the anodizing temperature in
   the range of 10-30 degrees {C} does not affect the cell size in {ATO} films.
   {A}nalyses of the pore diameter, pore circularity and regularity of the
   pore arrangement suggests that nanoporous anodic titania with the best
   pore arrangement can be formed in a controlled manner by anodization
   performed at 50 {V} and 20 degrees {C}. {S}urprisingly, below and above this
   critical potential difference and temperature, pore diameters are
   smaller and obtained {ATO} structures are less regular. {A}t higher
   anodizing temperatures, the regularity of pore arrangement observed at
   the surface and the pore diameter are considerably affected by the
   precipitated hydrous titanium dioxide. ({C}) 2013 {E}lsevier {L}td. {A}ll rights

   pore walls, with cation and anion transport numbers of anodic titania in
   the barrier layer region similar to those of barrier films and with
   field-assisted ejection of {T}i(4+) ions to the electrolyte, or by
